Project Title: Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

Overview: This project focuses on applying customer segmentation techniques on historical customer data using K-Means clustering. The aim is to partition the customer base into groups based on their characteristics and allocate marketing resources effectively.

Motivation: Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses as it helps in targeting specific groups of customers and retain high-profit, low-risk customers. This project aims to demonstrate the practical implementation of K-Means clustering for customer segmentation.

Learning Objectives:

Understanding the concept of customer segmentation
Familiarizing with the K-Means clustering algorithm
Pre-processing the customer dataset for modeling
Applying K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
Interpreting the insights from the clustering results.
Technical Aspect: This project uses Python programming language and the following libraries:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Numpy
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Scipy
Itertools
Pylab
Data Source: The customer data used in this project is obtained from the file "Cust_Segmentation.csv".

Project Structure: The project consists of the following steps:

Introduction
Importing the required libraries
Downloading the customer data
K-Means on a randomly generated dataset
Setting up K-Means
Creating the visual plot
Customer Segmentation with K-Means
Pre-processing the data
Modeling
Insights and conclusion.
Credits: This project is a self-practice project and all the code has been written from scratch.
